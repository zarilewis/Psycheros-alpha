# UI Features

Detailed documentation for Psycheros web UI features.

## Context Inspector

Built-in debugging tool for inspecting the full context sent to the LLM. Toggle via the code icon (`</>`) in the header.

## UI Component Patterns

Reference for correct usage of shared UI components. Follow these patterns when building new settings pages or UI elements to avoid rendering bugs.

### Toggle Switch

The toggle switch uses CSS sibling selectors (`input:checked + .toggle-slider`) which require a **flat structure** — the `<input>` and `<span class="toggle-slider">` must be direct siblings inside `<label class="toggle-label">`.

**Correct pattern (flat structure):**
```html
<label class="toggle-label">
  <input type="checkbox" id="my-toggle" role="switch" aria-label="Label Text" checked>
  <span class="toggle-slider"></span>
  <span class="toggle-text">Label Text</span>
</label>
```

**Incorrect pattern (nested label — breaks CSS selectors):**
```html
<label class="toggle-label" for="my-toggle">
  <span>Label Text</span>
  <label class="toggle">
    <input type="checkbox" id="my-toggle" checked>
    <span class="toggle-slider"></span>
  </label>
</label>
```

The nested `<label class="toggle">` wrapper breaks `input:checked + .toggle-slider` because there's an extra element between the input and the slider. This causes the accent color to not apply and the toggle to visually disappear when checked. **Do not use this pattern.**

**CSS:** `web/css/settings.css` (`.toggle-label`, `.toggle-slider`, `.toggle-text`). Used in: Appearance Settings, LLM Settings, Tools Settings, Image Gen Settings, Captioning Settings, Situational Awareness Settings.

## Context Inspector (continued)

**Architecture:** Context snapshots are persisted to the `context_snapshots` database table on each turn. The inspector fetches data via `GET /api/conversations/:id/context` — data survives page refresh and conversation switching. Capped at 50 snapshots per conversation (auto-pruned on insert).

**Turn Navigation:** Use the prev/next arrows to inspect any turn in the conversation, not just the latest.

**Search:** Full-text search across all snapshot content with match highlighting.

**Tabs:**
- **System**: Identity sections (self, user, relationship), situational awareness, and the full assembled system message as collapsible sections with size badges
- **RAG**: All five retrieval sources — memories, chat history, lorebook entries, data vault, knowledge graph
- **Messages**: Conversation history sent to the LLM with role badges and collapsible content
- **Tools**: Available tool definitions with parameters
- **Metrics**: Per-section size breakdown, token counts, and context window utilization bar

**Key types:** `LLMContextSnapshot` (in-memory, `src/types.ts`) and `ContextSnapshotRecord` (persisted, `src/types.ts`). Snapshot built in `EntityTurn.process()` (`src/entity/loop.ts`), persisted via `DBClient.addContextSnapshot()`.

## Temporal Awareness

Every message includes an XML-tagged timestamp in the LLM context, enabling the entity to understand when events occurred and time gaps between messages.

**Format**: `<t>YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM</t>`

XML tags are used so the LLM treats timestamps as structural metadata. These tags are **stripped from rendered output** — the user never sees them. Instead, timestamps are displayed as proper UI elements in message headers (drawn from database `createdAt` metadata).

**LLM context example:**
```
[user]: <t>2026-03-03 14:22</t> Hey, what did you think about our conversation yesterday?
[assistant]: <t>2026-03-03 14:23</t> I enjoyed our discussion about...
[user]: <t>2026-03-05 15:17</t> Can you summarize what we talked about?
```

**Display timestamps**: Shown in `.msg-header` as `msg-timestamp` elements. Time-only for today ("3:42 PM"), date + time for older messages ("Mar 14, 3:42 PM"). Server-side via `formatMessageTime()` in `templates.ts`, client-side via `formatChatTimestamp()` in `psycheros.js`.

**Timezone**: Configurable via General Settings UI. The selected timezone propagates to all server-side date/time formatting — message headers, snapshot dates, memory metadata, vault document dates, knowledge graph sync times, and daily memory summarization. Client-side streaming timestamps and the entity's temporal XML are also included. Empty selection falls back to the `TZ` environment variable, then the browser's local timezone for display.

Implemented in `src/entity/loop.ts` via `formatMessageTimestamp()`. XML stripping in `src/server/markdown.ts` and `web/js/psycheros.js`.

## Stop Generation

During streaming, the Send button transforms into a Stop button with two-tap confirmation to prevent accidental cancellation.

**States:**
1. **Stop** (orange with warning icon) — initial state during streaming
2. **Tap again** (pulsing amber) — confirmation required, resets after 3 seconds
3. **[Stopped]** — shown in the message when generation is halted

**Behavior:**
- Partial assistant response is **not persisted** when stopped
- User message **is persisted** (saved before streaming begins)
- Switching conversations mid-stream no longer aborts generation — the response continues in the background and is fully persisted to the database. When you switch back, the completed message is visible.
- The explicit Stop button (double-tap) still aborts generation and prevents persistence as before.

Implemented in `web/js/psycheros.js`: `requestStopGeneration()`, `stopGeneration()`. CSS in `web/css/components.css`.

## Retry Failed Turn

When a chat turn fails (rate limit, network error, upstream outage) and no assistant content was produced, a "Retry" button appears in the assistant bubble below the error message.

**Behavior:**
- Clicking Retry re-attempts the LLM call using the already-persisted user message — no duplicate is created in conversation history
- The error content is cleared and replaced with the new streaming response in the same bubble
- Stop button is available during retry, with the same double-tap confirmation
- If the retry also fails with no content, a new Retry button appears again
- Retry is not offered if the turn produced any assistant content, thinking, or tool calls (partial results are preserved)

**API:** `POST /api/chat/retry` with body `{ "conversationId": "..." }`

Implemented in `web/js/psycheros.js`: `retryFailedTurn()`. Server handler in `src/server/routes.ts`: `handleChatRetry()`. CSS in `web/css/components.css`: `.retry-btn`.

## Auto-Scroll

Smart proximity-based scroll latching replaces the naive "always scroll to bottom" approach. Matches standard chat app conventions.

**Behavior:**
- **Latched by default** — when the user is within 80px of the bottom, new content automatically scrolls into view
- **Scroll up to disengage** — scrolling away from the bottom unlatches auto-scroll immediately; the user can read history undisturbed during streaming
- **Scroll-to-bottom pill** — a circular button appears whenever the user is scrolled away from the bottom, not just during streaming
- **New-content badge** — a pulsing green dot on the pill indicates content has arrived while the user was scrolled up
- **Click pill to re-latch** — instant scroll during streaming (avoids race with growing content), smooth scroll when idle
- **Scroll back to bottom naturally** — also re-latches and dismisses the pill
- **Sending a message always latches** — user intent is unambiguous, view jumps to the new message

**Self-healing DOM:** The `AutoScroll` module detects stale DOM references (from HTMX swaps and `innerHTML` replacements) via `element.isConnected` checks and automatically reinitializes.

Implemented in `web/js/psycheros.js`: `AutoScroll` IIFE module. CSS in `web/css/components.css`: `.scroll-to-bottom-pill`, `.scroll-pill-badge`.

## Message Editing

Both user and assistant messages can be edited after they're sent.

**Features:**
- Edit button (pencil icon) appears on hover
- Inline editing with textarea replacing message content
- Save/Cancel buttons for confirming or discarding changes
- Edited messages shown with (edited) indicator in the UI
- `edited_at` timestamp stored in database (not passed to entity)
- ChatRAG re-indexing: edited messages are automatically re-indexed for semantic search

**API:** `PUT /api/messages/:id` with body `{ "content": "...", "conversationId": "..." }`

Implemented in `web/js/psycheros.js` and `src/server/state-changes.ts`.

## Markdown Rendering

Both user and assistant messages render markdown formatting with progressive streaming.

- **Server-side**: `renderMarkdown()` in `src/server/markdown.ts` uses `marked` + `DOMPurify`. Strips LLM XML artifacts (`<t>` timestamp tags, non-HTML XML wrappers) before rendering.
- **Client-side streaming**: Progressive markdown rendering — content is parsed and rendered live during streaming via debounced `marked.parse()` (40ms). A blinking block cursor (▌) appears inline during generation. Each content segment between tool calls is independently rendered.
- **Client-side completion**: On `done` event, final render applied, cursor removed, thinking/tool sections collapsed.
- **XML stripping**: `stripEntityXml()` removes `<t>timestamp</t>` tags (including content), partial tags at chunk boundaries, and non-HTML XML wrappers while preserving standard HTML tags.
- **Supported**: Headers, lists, code blocks, blockquotes, tables, links, emphasis
- **Dependencies**: `jsdom` provides DOM environment for DOMPurify sanitization

## General Settings

Customizable display names and timezone for the chat interface. Access via Settings → General Settings (first card in the settings hub).

### Display Names

- **Entity Name** — replaces "Assistant" in message headers across the chat UI
- **Your Name** — replaces "You" in message headers across the chat UI

### Timezone

- **Display Timezone** — dropdown of ~40 common IANA timezones grouped by region, with "(System Default)" option
- Affects all server-rendered date/time display: message timestamps, snapshot dates (Today/Yesterday labels), memory metadata, vault document dates, knowledge graph sync times, and daily memory summarization schedule
- Also affects client-streamed timestamps and entity temporal XML
- Empty selection uses the system/browser default

Settings are loaded on page init from the server and cached in `globalThis.PsycherosSettings` for instant access during streaming. Saving updates the in-memory cache immediately so new messages reflect the change without a page reload.

**Persistence:** Settings stored in `.psycheros/general-settings.json` on the server. Defaults: `{ "entityName": "Assistant", "userName": "You", "timezone": "" }`.

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/general-settings` — get current settings
- `POST /api/general-settings` — save settings (`{ "entityName": "...", "userName": "...", "timezone": "..." }`)
- `GET /fragments/settings/general` — render settings form fragment

## Appearance Settings

Customizable UI theming accessible via Settings → Appearance in the sidebar.

### Color Themes

8 preset themes: Cosmic, Ocean, Forest, Sunset, Lavender, Midnight, Ember, Frost. Each has distinct accent colors. Custom accent color also available via color picker.

### Background Images

- Upload custom backgrounds (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP up to 5MB)
- Apply backgrounds from URL
- Gallery with thumbnails, delete support
- Blur slider (0-20px) and overlay opacity slider (0-100%)

### Glass Effect

Frosted glass (glassmorphism) effect on UI panels when background is active. Uses `backdrop-filter: blur()` with semi-transparent backgrounds. Automatically hides dark overlay when enabled.

### Persistence

Theme preferences persist server-side in `.psycheros/appearance-settings.json`. On page load, the server is queried first and its values take precedence; localStorage acts as a synchronous cache for instant rendering and an offline fallback. On theme changes, settings are saved to both localStorage (immediate) and the server (async fire-and-forget). CSS variables in `web/css/tokens.css`.

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/appearance-settings` — get current appearance settings
- `POST /api/appearance-settings` — save appearance settings
- `GET /api/backgrounds` — list uploaded backgrounds
- `POST /api/backgrounds` — upload new background
- `DELETE /api/backgrounds/:filename` — delete background
- `GET /backgrounds/:filename` — serve background image file

## Tools Settings

Manage which tools are available to the entity. Access via Settings > Tools in the sidebar.

**Features:**
- Two tabs: **Built-in** and **Custom** — visually separates shipped tools from user-written ones
- Built-in tools grouped by category (System, Identity, Knowledge Graph, Data Vault, Web Search, Pulse, Memory, Image Generation)
- Toggle switches for each individual tool — changes take effect immediately (hot-reload)
- Per-category "Enable All" / "Disable All" buttons
- Global "Enable All" / "Disable All" buttons
- Expandable detail panel on each tool showing full description and JSON Schema parameters
- Custom tab includes an **Import Tool** button to upload `.js` files directly from the UI

**Settings Priority:**
1. User overrides (saved toggles) take precedence
2. Auto-enabled tools (e.g., `web_search` when a web search provider is configured) are always on
3. `PSYCHEROS_TOOLS` environment variable as fallback

**Persistence:** Settings stored in `.psycheros/tools-settings.json`. Only tools the user has explicitly toggled are stored (as `toolOverrides`). Defaults to empty (no overrides), meaning the env var controls initial behavior until the user makes changes via the UI.

**Custom Tools:**
- Place `.js` files in the `custom-tools/` directory at the project root, or use the **Import Tool** button on the Custom tab to upload from the UI
- Each file exports a default `Tool` object with `definition` and `execute` properties
- Imported files are saved to `custom-tools/` and the registry hot-reloads — no server restart needed
- Toggle them on to enable — no core code changes needed

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/tools-settings` — get all tools, categories, and current overrides
- `POST /api/tools-settings` — save overrides and hot-reload (`{ "toolOverrides": { "shell": true } }`)
- `POST /api/custom-tools/upload` — upload a `.js` custom tool file (multipart/form-data, field `tool`, max 100KB)
- `GET /fragments/settings/tools` — render Tools settings page fragment

**Source files:** `src/tools/tools-settings.ts`, `src/tools/custom-loader.ts`, `src/server/templates.ts`, `src/server/routes.ts`, `web/css/settings.css`

## Inline Image Display

Generated images render inline in chat messages. The entity uses the `generate_image` tool and images appear directly in the conversation as the tool result is processed.

**Features:**
- Images display inline with a subtle container and generator name metadata
- Auto-generated image descriptions displayed below the image (via the configured captioning provider)
- Images persist across conversation switches via `[IMAGE:...]` markers stored in the assistant message content
- Descriptions are included in the marker JSON and rendered from persisted messages
- Lazy loading (`loading="lazy"`) for performance
- Server-side rendered in `renderAssistantMessage()` for persisted messages, client-side rendered during SSE streaming

**SSE event:** `image_generated` with JSON payload `{ imagePath, prompt, generatorName, description }`.

Implemented in `web/js/psycheros.js` (SSE handler), `src/server/templates.ts` (server-side rendering), `web/css/components.css` (`.generated-image-container`, `.generated-image`, `.generated-image-meta`, `.generated-image-desc`).

## Chat Image Attachments

Users can attach images to chat messages for the entity to reference in generation or conversation.

**Features:**
- Clip icon button next to the chat input
- File picker accepts images (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP)
- Thumbnail preview shown below the input after selecting a file
- Remove button to cancel the attachment before sending
- On send, the attachment is uploaded and its ID is included in the chat request
- The attachment is automatically captioned via the configured vision model before being passed to the entity
- The user message is prefixed with `[USER_IMAGE: /chat-attachments/filename | Caption: description]` so the entity understands the image content
- If captioning fails or is not configured, falls back to path-only: `[USER_IMAGE: /chat-attachments/filename]`
- The entity can use `user_image_path` in `generate_image` to incorporate the attached image
- The entity can use `describe_image` with the path to get a more detailed description

**API:** `POST /api/chat-attachments` (multipart upload), returns `{ id, filename, url }`. Files stored in `.psycheros/chat-attachments/`. Captioning is handled server-side in `handleChat` before creating the entity turn.

Implemented in `web/js/psycheros.js` (`handleAttachment()`, `removeAttachment()`), `src/server/routes.ts` (`handleUploadChatAttachment`, auto-caption flow), `web/css/components.css` (`.attach-btn`, `.attachment-preview`, `.attachment-thumb`, `.attachment-remove`).

## System Admin Panel

Built-in diagnostics and log viewer for inspecting system health without shell access. Access via Settings → System Admin.

### Diagnostics Dashboard

Aggregates health data from 7 subsystems into a single view:

- **Overview**: Uptime, active SSE clients, database file size
- **Database**: Row counts for conversations, messages, lorebooks, lorebook_entries, memory_summaries
- **Vector System**: sqlite-vec availability/version, sync status between main tables and vec0 virtual tables
- **RAG**: Enabled status, indexed file count, chunk count
- **Memory Consolidation**: Enabled status, summary counts by granularity (daily/weekly/monthly/yearly), summarized chat count
- **MCP (entity-core)**: Connection status, last sync timestamp, pending identity/memory count
- **Knowledge Graph**: Node and edge counts

Data cached for 5 seconds to avoid hammering SQLite on rapid refreshes. Manual refresh via button.

### Log Viewer

Ring buffer capturing the last 1,000 log entries from all `console.*` calls. Component tags are parsed from `[Bracket]` prefixes in log messages.

**Filtering:**
- By level (Error, Warning, Info)
- By component tag (DB, RAG, MCP, Server, etc.)
- By entry count limit (50, 100, 250, 500)

**Copy to clipboard** formats logs as markdown with a fenced code block — designed for pasting into an LLM for analysis. Diagnostics copy produces structured markdown with sections matching the dashboard.

Timestamps render in the browser's local timezone (not the server's).

### Actions

Manual operations panel for running one-off maintenance tasks. Currently hosts:

- **Batch Populate Knowledge Graph**: Runs `entity-core/scripts/batch-populate-graph.ts` to backfill the knowledge graph from existing memory files. Extracts entities and relationships via LLM, creates `memory_ref` nodes with mentions edges, and generates embeddings. Idempotent — already-processed memories are skipped.

**Parameters:**
- **Days** (default 30) — how far back to look for memories
- **Granularity** — `daily`, `weekly`, `monthly`, `yearly`, `significant`, or `all`
- **Dry run** — extract entities without writing to the graph
- **Verbose** — show per-entity detail in output

Output includes exit code and full script stdout/stderr. The script runs as a subprocess against entity-core, so it uses entity-core's data directory and LLM settings (passed through from the Psycheros environment).

**Source files:** `src/server/logger.ts`, `src/server/diagnostics.ts`, `src/server/admin-routes.ts`, `src/server/admin-templates.ts`, `web/js/admin.js`, `web/css/admin.css`

## Knowledge Graph Editor

Mobile-first card list editor with an optional network graph toggle for the knowledge graph stored in entity-core. Requires MCP connection (`PSYCHEROS_MCP_ENABLED=true`).

Access via Settings → Entity Core → Knowledge Graph tab.

**List View (default):**
- Card list with type badges, labels, and connection counts
- Expand a card to see description, connections list, and Edit/Connect/Delete actions
- Virtual scrolling for smooth performance with large graphs
- Search nodes by label/description (instant client-side filtering)
- Filter by node type
- "Add Node" toolbar button opens a create modal

**Network View (optional toggle):**
- vis-network graph visualization, lazy-loaded on first toggle
- Node details slide-in panel with connections and actions
- Zoom/fit controls
- Search and type filter highlight matching nodes

**Editing:**
- Create/edit nodes (label, description, type)
- Connect nodes via modal with searchable node pickers and relationship type suggestions
- Edit modal shows existing connections with individual delete buttons
- Delete nodes uses a confirmation modal (no browser `prompt()` or `confirm()`)

**Source files:** `web/js/graph-view.js` (dynamically loaded), `web/css/graph.css`

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/graph` — full graph data (nodes, edges, stats)
- `POST /api/graph/nodes` — create node
- `PUT /api/graph/nodes/:id` — update node
- `DELETE /api/graph/nodes/:id` — delete node
- `POST /api/graph/edges` — create edge
- `PUT /api/graph/edges/:id` — update edge
- `DELETE /api/graph/edges/:id` — delete edge

## Data Vault

Document storage and search system accessible via Settings → Data Vault in the sidebar. Documents are chunked, embedded, and proactively searched every turn for context injection.

**Features:**
- Upload documents (.md, .txt, .pdf, .docx, .xlsx up to 10MB)
- Set scope: global (all conversations) or per-chat (single conversation)
- Document cards showing title, file type, scope, chunk count, size, source (upload/entity), date
- View/Edit documents with a rendered markdown view mode (default) and textarea edit mode
- Cancel button to discard edits and return to the vault list
- Delete documents with confirmation
- Entity can also create/edit vault documents via `vault` tool
- Descriptive file naming: `vault_{date}_{slug}.md` with automatic conflict resolution

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/vault` — list documents
- `POST /api/vault` — upload document
- `GET /api/vault/:id` — get document metadata
- `PUT /api/vault/:id` — update document
- `DELETE /api/vault/:id` — delete document
- `POST /api/vault/search` — search vault

**Source files:** `src/vault/manager.ts`, `src/vault/processor.ts`, `src/tools/vault-tools.ts`, `src/server/routes.ts`

## Memories Editor

Review and edit the entity's recorded memories accessible via Settings → Memories in the sidebar. Modeled after the Core Prompts UI with the same tabbed navigation pattern.

**Features:**
- Five tabs: Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Yearly, Significant
- File lists sorted newest-first, each linking to a full editor
- Editor displays read-only metadata (source instance, created/updated timestamps, version) when available from entity-core
- Save writes the local file, pushes an overwrite update to entity-core via MCP (if connected), and reindexes the file in RAG
- Significant tab includes a Create form for manually adding new significant memories
- Catch-up tab shows consolidation status (weekly/monthly/yearly) with a Run Catch-up button that backfills all missed periods in the background, with results displayed via SSE
- Works in offline mode (no MCP) — edits are saved locally only

**Flow:**
1. Settings hub → Memories card → tabbed view
2. Click tab → file list for that granularity
3. Click file → editor with textarea
4. Edit and Save → writes local file + MCP update + RAG reindex
5. Or (Significant tab): fill date + content → Create → new memory file

**MCP Integration:**
- **Read**: If MCP is connected, `memory_read` fetches richer metadata from entity-core (source instance, timestamps, version). Falls back to local file.
- **Save**: Calls `memory_update` on entity-core (explicit overwrite, no append merge). Falls back to local-only if MCP is disconnected.
- **Create**: Calls `memory_create` on entity-core for new significant memories.
- **RAG**: `MemoryIndexer.reindexFile()` processes only the changed file — removes old chunks, re-reads, re-chunks, re-embeds, re-stores.

**Security:**
- Granularity validated against allowed values
- Date validated against entity-core's regex (`^\d{4}(-W\d{2}|(-\d{2})?(-\d{2})?)$`)
- Path traversal prevented by sanitizing date/granularity before file path construction
- Only significant memories can be created new; other granularities are edit-only

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /fragments/settings/memories` — tabbed view
- `GET /fragments/settings/memories/consolidation` — catch-up status tab
- `GET /fragments/settings/memories/:granularity` — file list
- `GET /fragments/settings/memories/:granularity/:date` — editor
- `POST /api/memories/:granularity/:date` — save edited memory
- `POST /api/memories/significant/create` — create new significant memory
- `POST /api/memories/consolidation/run` — run catch-up consolidation

**Source files:** `src/server/templates.ts` (render functions), `src/server/routes.ts` (handlers), `src/mcp-client/mod.ts` (MCP methods), `src/rag/indexer.ts` (reindexFile)

## Pulse System

Autonomous prompt scheduling system accessible via Settings → Pulse in the sidebar. The entity can act on its own initiative by processing user-defined prompts on schedules, timers, or external triggers.

**Features:**
- Tabbed view: Prompts list and Execution Log
- Create, edit, enable/disable, and delete Pulses
- Manual "Run Now" trigger for any Pulse
- Conversations with active Pulses show a heartbeat indicator in the sidebar

**Timezone-Aware Scheduling:**
When `PSYCHEROS_DISPLAY_TZ` (or `TZ`) is set, daily/weekly/monthly and one-shot schedules are automatically converted from the user's local timezone to UTC before being stored as cron expressions. The editor pre-fills and list view display times in local time. Advanced cron expressions are not converted and are always interpreted in UTC. If no timezone is configured, behavior is unchanged (times treated as UTC).

**Trigger Types:**
- **Scheduled** — Friendly presets (every N minutes/hours, daily at time, weekly on day, monthly on date) plus advanced cron expression
- **One-shot** — Fire once at a specific datetime, then auto-disable
- **Inactivity** — Fire after no user messages across all chats for a set duration, with optional ±35% random jitter for organic feel
- **Webhook** — External trigger via `POST /api/webhook/pulse/:id` with Bearer token authentication (rate-limited to 1 per 10s)
- **Filesystem** — Watch a directory for file creation/modification events (debounced at 1s)

**Chat Modes:**
- **Visible** — Entity response streams in real-time to the assigned conversation. The Pulse prompt appears as a visually distinct system message (centered, accent-colored border, EKG Pulse icon header with timestamp). The entity's response streams live with full markdown rendering, thinking display, and tool call cards — identical to regular chat streaming.
- **Silent** — Entity processes the prompt in the background; output stored in execution log only

**Visible Mode Behavior:**
- The Pulse prompt message appears in real-time with the entity's accent color border and Pulse icon
- The entity perceives Pulse messages as system-initiated via a `[System — Pulse "name"]` prefix, not as user messages
- Responses stream via the persistent SSE channel (content, thinking, tool_call, tool_result, done, message_id events)
- Input is disabled during Pulse streaming; the stop button appears (double-tap to confirm)
- Chat auto-scrolls as Pulse content arrives
- Pulse message metadata (pulse_id, pulse_name) is stored on messages for traceability
- **Streaming fallback**: If the persistent SSE connection drops during pulse execution (common during idle periods), a `pulse_complete` event triggers a conversation reload so the response is always visible even when real-time streaming was missed

**Pulse Chaining:**
- Pulses can chain into other Pulses for complex workflows
- Cycle detection via ancestry walking and max chain depth (default 3)
- Errors in chained Pulses don't prevent sibling chains

**Entity-Created Pulses:**
- Entity can create, trigger, and delete Pulses via the `pulse` tool
- Entity-created Pulses default to silent mode and auto-delete after successful execution

**Execution Log:**
- Paginated table showing time, pulse name, trigger source, status, duration, tool call count, and result preview
- Filterable by pulse ID and status

**Inactivity Trigger Details:**
- The inactivity timer starts from when the Pulse is saved/enabled, not retroactively from the last user message
- User activity (sending a message) resets the inactivity clock
- A cooldown equal to the threshold prevents rapid-fire re-execution when the user stays inactive
- With random jitter enabled, the fire window uses absolute elapsed times (e.g., a 10-min threshold with jitter fires between 6.5–13.5 min), not threshold + offset
- If the probability-based jitter window is missed, the Pulse falls through and fires once the threshold is exceeded (rather than being permanently suppressed)

**Source files:** `src/pulse/engine.ts`, `src/pulse/routes.ts`, `src/pulse/templates.ts`, `src/pulse/timezone.ts`, `src/tools/pulse-tools.ts`, `src/db/client.ts` (pulse run persistence), `web/js/psycheros.js` (switchTab, savePulse, updatePulseTriggerFields, pulse_complete handler), `web/css/settings.css` (pulse-specific styles), `web/css/components.css` (.msg--pulse styles)

## Situational Awareness

Real-time signal feeds injected into the entity's context every turn, giving it awareness of the user's presence and environment. Access via Settings → Situational Awareness in the sidebar.

**Settings UI:**
- Enable/disable toggle to control whether the SA block is included in context
- Active Signals section listing built-in feeds with descriptions
- Future Feeds placeholder for upcoming signal types

**Built-in Signals:**

- **Last User Interaction** — Tracks the most recent human message across all threads (excluding automated Pulse messages). The entity sees the timestamp (formatted in the user's display timezone) and which thread the message was sent in (ID + title).

- **Device Detection** — Frontend detects whether the user is on desktop or mobile using the existing `isMobileDevice()` heuristic (Android/iPhone/iPad/iPod UA or touch points + viewport width). The device type is sent with each `/api/chat` request and included in the SA block as a simple `desktop` or `mobile` indicator.

**Context Format:**

The SA block is injected into the system message as structured XML, placed after custom identity files and before lorebook/RAG content:

```xml
<situational_awareness>
  <last_user_interaction>
    <timestamp><t>2026-04-10 14:32</t></timestamp>
    <thread id="abc-123">Thread Title</thread>
  </last_user_interaction>
  <current_device>desktop</current_device>
</situational_awareness>
```

**Pulse Exclusion:** Pulse-triggered messages are excluded from the last user interaction query (`WHERE pulse_id IS NULL`), so the entity only sees the timestamp of genuine human messages.

**Persistence:** Settings stored in `.psycheros/sa-settings.json`. Defaults to `{ "enabled": true }`.

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/sa-settings` — get current SA settings
- `POST /api/sa-settings` — save SA settings
- `GET /fragments/settings/sa` — render SA settings page fragment

**Source files:** `src/entity/loop.ts` (SA block builder, `escapeXml`, `ProcessOptions.deviceType`), `src/entity/context.ts` (injection into `buildSystemMessage`), `src/db/client.ts` (`getLatestUserInteraction`), `src/server/routes.ts` (handlers), `src/server/templates.ts` (`renderSASettings`), `web/js/psycheros.js` (`deviceType` in request body, Context Inspector rendering)
