# Security Audit

Status: **Complete** — reviewed for homelab deployment behind Authelia.

## Threat Model

Single-user homelab, Docker container, Authelia reverse proxy. All HTTP endpoints are auth-gated by Authelia before reaching Psycheros. This context downgrades many theoretical risks that would be critical in a multi-user or public deployment.

## Findings Summary

| # | Issue | Severity | Status |
|---|-------|----------|--------|
| S1 | Path traversal in entity-core identity tool schemas | Critical | **FIXED** (in entity-core) |
| S2 | XSS in templates.ts hx-confirm attribute | High | **FIXED** |
| S3 | XSS in templates.ts background gallery onclick handlers | High | **FIXED** |
| S4 | Shell tool — no sandboxing | High | **Accepted** — by design |
| S5 | SSRF via LLM test endpoint | Medium | **Accepted** — by design |
| S6 | Open CORS (`*`) on all endpoints | Medium | **Accepted** — behind Authelia |
| S7 | No request body size limits (most endpoints) | Low | **FIXED** |
| S8 | Error messages leak internal paths | Low | **FIXED** |
| S9 | No auth/IDOR checks on HTTP routes | Low | **Accepted** — Authelia handles auth |
| S10 | MIME type validation trusts client-provided type | Low | **Accepted** — filenames are server-generated |

## Fixed in Psycheros

- **S2 (XSS)**: `src/server/templates.ts:1110` — `categoryLabel` and `displayName` now wrapped with `escapeHtml()` in hx-confirm attributes
- **S3 (XSS)**: `src/server/templates.ts:~2411-2416` — added client-side `escapeAttr()` helper for all interpolated values in background gallery onclick handlers
- **S7 (Body limits)**: Content-Length enforcement: 1MB for JSON/form, 10MB for uploads, returns 413
- **S8 (Error leaks)**: 18 catch blocks sanitized — generic messages to clients, real errors logged server-side

## Fixed in entity-core

- **S1 (Path traversal)**: `src/tools/identity.ts` — created shared `SafeFilenameSchema` with regex `/^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+\.md$/`, applied to all 5 identity tool schemas. See [entity-core code review](https://github.com/zarilewis/entity-core) for details.

## Accepted Risks (with rationale)

### S4: Shell tool — no sandboxing
Executes arbitrary commands via `sh -c` with no allowlist, chroot, or path restrictions. This is an intentional feature — the entity uses it for file operations, git, etc. Gated by `PSYCHEROS_TOOLS` env var which defaults to `[]` (no tools enabled). User must explicitly opt in.

### S5: SSRF via LLM test endpoint
Accepts arbitrary `baseUrl` for LLM connection testing. By design — users configure their own LLM provider URL. Behind Authelia, only the homelab owner can access this.

### S6: Open CORS
`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` on all endpoints. Behind Authelia reverse proxy, cross-origin requests still need valid auth cookies. Not exploitable in this deployment model.

### S9: No per-route auth
All endpoints access resources by ID without user-level authorization. Single-user system behind Authelia — no concept of multiple users.

## Confirmed Safe Patterns

- **SQLite queries** — all parameterized across both repos
- **User/assistant message rendering** — goes through `marked` + `DOMPurify` (XSS-safe)
- **Tool arguments and results** — HTML-escaped via `escapeHtml()`
- **Memory tool inputs** — Zod enum for granularity + regex for date
- **API keys** — masked in settings UI via `maskApiKey()`
- **Background file upload** — server-generated filenames, MIME type whitelist, 5MB size limit
- **Background file delete** — regex `/^[a-zA-Z0-9_.-]+$/` blocks traversal after URL decoding
- **Identity file editor** — `isValidFilename()` validates against `../`, `/`, `\` before path construction
