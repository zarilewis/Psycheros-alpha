# Memory System & RAG

Psycheros implements a hierarchical memory system where the entity writes their own memories from conversations. Memory storage and retrieval are delegated entirely to [entity-core](https://github.com/zarilewis/entity-core) via MCP — Psycheros maintains no local memory files. Three RAG systems provide contextual recall.

## Memory Architecture

**Entity-core is the sole authority for all memories.** Psycheros reads, writes, searches, and deletes memories exclusively through MCP tool calls. This eliminates sync issues, stale local copies, and duplicate indexing.

What Psycheros still manages locally:
- **Chat history** — conversations and messages in SQLite
- **Chat RAG** — vector search over conversation history
- **Data Vault RAG** — document storage and eager search
- **Memory summary tracking** — `memory_summaries` and `summarized_chats` DB tables record which days have been summarized (prevents re-processing)

What entity-core manages:
- **Memory storage** — all memory files (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, significant)
- **Memory RAG** — vector indexing and semantic search over memories
- **Consolidation** — weekly/monthly/yearly summarization via cron jobs with catch-up

## Memory Hierarchy

Memories are written in the entity's voice (first-person), referring to the user by their actual name and preferred pronouns. All summarization LLM calls receive the entity's full identity context as a system message, so memories reflect the entity's personality and knowledge of the user. They are organized hierarchically and consolidated over time.

Daily summarization runs in Psycheros (it has conversation context) but writes the result to entity-core via MCP. When `PSYCHEROS_DISPLAY_TZ` is configured, the cron fires at 5 AM in the user's local timezone and messages are grouped by logical local date (a 5 AM cutoff means messages from 5 AM today to 4:59 AM tomorrow are the same "day"). Without a configured timezone, it falls back to `PSYCHEROS_MEMORY_HOUR` at UTC (default: 4 AM). Weekly, monthly, and yearly consolidation runs in entity-core via its own cron jobs, independently of whether any Psycheros instance is connected.

### Memory Types

| Type | Description | Created By | Stored In |
|------|-------------|------------|-----------|
| **Daily** | Auto-generated conversation summaries | Psycheros via MCP | entity-core |
| **Weekly** | Consolidated from daily entries | entity-core cron (Sunday 5 AM) | entity-core |
| **Monthly** | Consolidated from weekly entries | entity-core cron (1st of month 5 AM) | entity-core |
| **Yearly** | Consolidated from monthly entries | entity-core cron (January 1st 5 AM) | entity-core |
| **Significant** | Emotionally important events, permanently remembered | Entity via `create_significant_memory` tool | entity-core |

### Trigger

On startup and via daily cron, Psycheros checks for unsummarized dates (days with messages not yet recorded in `memory_summaries`). The cron fires at 5 AM in the user's local timezone (when `PSYCHEROS_DISPLAY_TZ` is set), or at `PSYCHEROS_MEMORY_HOUR` UTC (default: 4 AM) as a fallback. On startup, `repairOrphanedSummaries()` detects DB records where the corresponding memory doesn't exist in entity-core (e.g., from a failed MCP write), clears them, and re-summarizes.

### Consolidation Schedule

- **Daily summarization**: Psycheros cron at 5 AM local time (or `PSYCHEROS_MEMORY_HOUR` UTC fallback) — uses the active profile's worker model, stored in entity-core
- **Weekly**: entity-core cron (Sunday 5 AM UTC) — runs in entity-core with catch-up
- **Monthly**: entity-core cron (1st of month 5 AM UTC) — runs in entity-core with catch-up
- **Yearly**: entity-core cron (January 1st 5 AM UTC) — runs in entity-core with catch-up

Weekly, monthly, and yearly consolidation run independently in entity-core regardless of whether Psycheros is connected. Entity-core's cron jobs include catch-up logic that finds and processes any missed periods.

### Instance Tagging

Memories are tagged with `sourceInstance` to track which embodiment created them. Each bullet point in memory content includes inline `[chat:id]` and `[via:instanceId]` tags so the entity can identify the source of individual memories when multiple embodiments contribute to the same file.

### MCP Requirements

Memory operations require entity-core to be connected (`PSYCHEROS_MCP_ENABLED=true`). If MCP is unavailable:
- Daily summarization does not run (no point — memories can't be stored)
- Memory browser UI returns 503 errors
- `create_significant_memory` tool fails with an error message

## RAG Systems

Three RAG systems provide contextual information before each LLM call, plus the Data Vault for user/entity-uploaded documents.

### Memory RAG (via MCP)

Retrieves relevant memories from entity-core's memory store via the `memory_search` MCP tool.

1. **Query**: Before processing each message, the user's message is sent to entity-core's semantic memory search
2. **Results**: Entity-core returns scored excerpts with granularity, date, and relevance percentage
3. **Context**: Retrieved memories are injected into the system prompt with relevance scores
4. **No local indexing**: All memory embeddings and vector search happen in entity-core
5. **Excerpt behavior**: Short memories (<2000 chars) are returned in full; longer memories get the most relevant section with context (~512 tokens). No truncation markers.

**Known limitation**: entity-core embeds each memory file as a single blob truncated to 3000 chars. Daily and weekly memories are typically under 3KB, but monthly/yearly/significant memories may grow beyond this over time, making content past the 3000-char mark unsearchable. The old Psycheros chunker split files into ~512-token pieces and embedded each independently — entity-core does not currently do this.

### Chat RAG

Semantic search over conversation history.

1. **Automatic Indexing**: Every message is embedded when saved (non-blocking)
2. **Tiered Search**: First searches current conversation; if no good matches (score < 0.5), expands to all conversations
3. **Relevance Filtering**: Only messages above minimum similarity score (0.3) are included
4. **Historical Context**: Helps the entity remember what was discussed previously
5. **Thread Tagging**: Each retrieved message includes a trailing `[chat:id]` tag matching the daily memory convention, so the entity can identify which conversation a message originated from

One-time migration for existing messages:
```bash
deno run -A scripts/index-messages.ts
```

### Graph RAG

Knowledge graph context when MCP is enabled. The entity can both read from and write to its knowledge graph during conversation. The graph is a relational index of durable state (relationships, preferences, attributes) — not narrative memory.

**Context injection (automatic):**
1. **Semantic Search**: Queries the knowledge graph for relevant nodes using vector similarity (embeddings auto-generated via all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
2. **Graph Traversal**: Follows edges to find connected concepts (depth 1 by default)
3. **Anchor Nodes**: Includes "me" and "user" nodes when referenced by edges in the result set
4. **Context Injection**: Relevant nodes and relationships are formatted in compact one-line-per-relationship format and added to the system prompt

**Context format example:**
```
---
Relevant Knowledge from Graph:
user friends_with Sarah (had a bad argument Aug 2020, reconciled since)
user drives_a Subaru (red 2010 WRX)
Sarah dating Mike (met through user)
```

**Graph building (via tools):**
- The entity can create/update nodes and edges during conversation using 7 write tools
- All node creation auto-generates vector embeddings for semantic search
- Duplicate prevention: creating a node with an existing label+type returns the existing node
- Batch operations support referencing existing nodes by label (e.g., "me", "user")
- Only durable state should be stored (people, preferences, places, goals, beliefs, health) — events and episodes belong in the memory system

Requires `PSYCHEROS_MCP_ENABLED=true`.

### Vault RAG (Data Vault)

Eager RAG over user-uploaded and entity-created reference documents. Documents are chunked, embedded, and proactively searched every turn — always available, no keyword triggers needed.

**Document storage:**
- Users upload via Settings → Data Vault UI or `POST /api/vault` (supports .md, .txt, .pdf, .docx, .xlsx)
- Entity creates/updates via `vault` tool (saved as markdown)
- Template seeding: `.md` files in `templates/vault/` are automatically indexed into the global vault on first startup (skipped if already present). Used for pre-populated documents like welcome messages.
- Files stored at `data/vault/documents/{global|chat-{convId}}/`
- Content extracted, chunked (512 tokens), embedded (all-MiniLM-L6-v2, 384 dims)

**Scope:**
- **Global** — available in every conversation
- **Per-chat** — only searched in the matching conversation

**Retrieval:**
1. Every turn, the user message is embedded and compared against all vault chunks
2. Always includes global documents; per-chat documents only when conversation matches
3. Top results (default 5 chunks, 1500 token budget, min 0.3 similarity) formatted and injected
4. Falls back to in-memory cosine similarity when sqlite-vec is unavailable

**Context injection order:** base instructions → identity → lorebook → **vault** → memories → chat history → graph

**Entity tools:**
| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `vault` | Manage vault documents (write, read, append, list, search) |

### Vector Search Backend

- **Primary**: sqlite-vec extension for efficient vector similarity search
  - Linux (Docker): `lib/vec0.so` (x86-64)
  - macOS: `lib/vec0.dylib` (aarch64)
- **Fallback**: In-memory cosine similarity calculation when extension is unavailable
- **Embeddings**: HuggingFace `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model (384 dimensions)
- **Used for**: Chat RAG, Vault RAG, Graph RAG (all local to Psycheros)
- **Memory RAG**: Handled by entity-core via MCP (not local)
