# Code Review Findings

Status: **Complete** — all critical and high-severity issues fixed. Post-alpha fixes below.

## Scope

Full code review covering code quality, error handling, input validation, SQLite usage, LLM client robustness, frontend security, memory/RAG correctness, and tool execution safety.

## Initial Observations

- ~69 TypeScript source files, ~320 total files
- No automated tests — validation done via manual browser testing
- No linting/formatting config beyond Deno defaults
- Server-side HTML rendering in `templates.ts` (~1000 LOC)
- Raw HTTP server (no framework) — all routing/parsing is manual
- Custom SSE implementation

## Bugs Found and Fixed

### Tools default behavior (High — security)
- **Problem**: `PSYCHEROS_TOOLS` defaulted to all tools enabled when env var unset, contradicting `.env.example` docs that said "no tools enabled by default". This meant the shell tool (arbitrary command execution) was active by default.
- **Location**: `src/main.ts:22-24`
- **Fix**: Changed default from `return ["all"]` to `return []`

### Service worker cached stale assets (High — UX)
- **Problem**: Old SBy UI persisted in Chrome even after code updates. Cache name `sby-v4` and precache list referenced `/js/sby.js` (now `psycheros.js`).
- **Fix**: Renamed cache to `psycheros-v1`, updated asset list, old caches auto-purge

### Extra newlines in assistant messages (Medium — UX)
- **Problem**: CSS `white-space: pre-wrap` on `.assistant-text` preserved literal whitespace from HTML between `<p>` tags. Compounded by `breaks: true` in server-side marked config.
- **Fix**: Changed to `white-space: normal` and `breaks: false`

### `htmx:oobErrorNoTarget` on conversation switch (Low — console noise)
- **Problem**: OOB swap for `#header-title` had no target element in the header template.
- **Fix**: Added `<span id="header-title">` to header; conversation title now displays in header bar

### Identity files overwritten by entity (Medium — data loss on deploy)
- **Problem**: Entity writes to `identity/user/` files during chat, overwriting tracked git files. Solved by gitignoring identity directories and seeding from templates on first run.

## Security Fixes

### XSS in hx-confirm attribute (High)
- **Location**: `src/server/templates.ts:1110`
- **Problem**: `categoryLabel` and `displayName` interpolated into `hx-confirm` attribute without HTML escaping
- **Fix**: Wrapped with `escapeHtml()`

### XSS in background gallery onclick handlers (High)
- **Location**: `src/server/templates.ts:~2411-2416`
- **Problem**: `bg.url` and `bg.filename` interpolated into inline onclick handlers without escaping
- **Fix**: Added client-side `escapeAttr()` helper, applied to all interpolated values

### Request body size limits (Low)
- **Problem**: No Content-Length enforcement on most endpoints
- **Fix**: 1MB for JSON/form, 10MB for uploads, returns 413

### Error message sanitization (Low)
- **Problem**: 18 catch blocks leaked internal paths to clients
- **Fix**: Generic messages to clients, real errors logged server-side

## LLM Client Resilience (Session 17)

### No timeout on LLM API fetch (Critical — availability)
- **Problem**: `fetch()` call to Z.ai API had no timeout. If the API hung or was unreachable, Psycheros would block indefinitely — silent stall, no error, no logging.
- **Location**: `src/llm/client.ts` — `makeRequest()`
- **Fix**: Added `AbortController` with 30s connection timeout (configurable via `connectTimeout`). Throws `LLMError` with code `CONNECT_TIMEOUT`.

### No stall detection on streaming response (Critical — availability)
- **Problem**: `reader.read()` on the SSE stream body had no timeout. If the API accepted the connection (HTTP 200) then stopped sending data mid-stream, the reader blocked indefinitely.
- **Location**: `src/llm/client.ts` — `chatStream()` read loop
- **Fix**: Added `readWithTimeout()` wrapper with 60s stall timeout (configurable via `streamStallTimeout`). Cancels the reader on timeout to tear down the TCP connection. Throws `LLMError` with code `STREAM_STALL_TIMEOUT`.

### Silent malformed chunk swallowing (Medium — observability)
- **Problem**: `parseSSELine()` returned `null` on JSON parse failure, same as empty lines. Consumers silently skipped it. If the API sent consistently malformed data, the user got an empty response with no error.
- **Location**: `src/llm/client.ts` — `parseSSELine()`
- **Fix**: Returns `"malformed"` sentinel. After 5 consecutive malformed chunks, throws `LLMError` with code `MALFORMED_STREAM`.

### Generic error message hid failure category (Medium — observability)
- **Problem**: All LLM errors surfaced as `"An error occurred while processing your message"` — no distinction between timeout, network failure, rate limit, auth error, or server error. Status event sent raw JSON that the client displayed as a string.
- **Location**: `src/server/routes.ts` — chat catch block; `web/js/psycheros.js` — status event handler
- **Fix**: Error switch in routes.ts maps error codes to descriptive user-facing messages. Client-side parses JSON status events and displays error text with toast notification.

### No logging on LLM request lifecycle (Low — observability)
- **Problem**: Zero log output between context-loading and error catch. Impossible to tell from logs whether a request was sent, when connection established, or how long streaming took.
- **Location**: `src/llm/client.ts`
- **Fix**: Added `[LLM]` tagged logging: request send (model, message count, tools), connect timing, stream completion stats, abnormal stream termination warnings.

### Tool results invisible after finish_reason=tool_calls (High — UX)
- **Problem**: The entity loop yields a `done` SSE event after every LLM call, including when `finish_reason=tool_calls`. The client's `done` handler unconditionally tore down the streaming UI — removing the streaming indicator, collapsing all thinking/tool sections, and calling `AutoScroll.streamEnd()`. Since tools hadn't executed yet, the user saw the interface go quiet with no visual feedback. Tool results, when they arrived, were appended to now-collapsed tool cards (invisible unless manually expanded). Auto-scroll was deactivated (`_streaming = false`), so subsequent content from the next LLM iteration never scrolled into view. This was most visible with tools like `maintain_identity` and `web_search` where the model reasons then calls a tool with no intermediate text content (e.g., "54 thinking chunks, 0 content").
- **Locations**: `web/js/psycheros.js` — `done` event handler (line ~1811), `tool_result` event handler (line ~1693)
- **Fix**: The `done` handler now checks `data` (the `finishReason` string). When `finishReason === "tool_calls"`, sections are still collapsed but the streaming indicator is kept and `AutoScroll.streamEnd()` is not called — keeping auto-scroll active for tool results and the next LLM iteration. The `tool_result` handler now re-expands the tool card after adding the result, so the output is visible to the user. The final `done` event (with `finishReason: "stop"`, `"length"`, etc.) still triggers full teardown as before.

## Known Issues (deferred)

### Type errors in `src/tools/graph-read.ts`
- 4 type errors at lines 472, 477, 487, 492 — `as` casts from specific arg types to `Record<string, unknown>` that TypeScript rejects
- App runs fine (Deno doesn't type-check at runtime) but `deno check` fails on these
- Fix: Cast through `unknown` first, or make the tool registry generic over arg types

### sqlite-vec on macOS
- Native extensions available for both platforms: `lib/vec0.so` (Linux x86-64) and `lib/vec0.dylib` (macOS aarch64)
- sqlite-vec loads natively on both macOS and Docker — no fallback needed
- Auto-download: if no matching extension is found at startup, the correct binary is downloaded from GitHub releases (v0.1.9) and cached in `lib/`. Covers Windows as well.

### graph_create_edge rejects labels with cryptic JSON error (Medium — UX)
- `graph_create_edge` only accepted `fromId`/`toId` but entity naturally used `fromLabel`/`toLabel` (consistent with `graph_write_batch`)
- Undefined IDs passed to entity-core → Zod validation failure → MCP error returned as plain text → Psycheros `JSON.parse()` threw `SyntaxError`
- Fix: Added `fromLabel`/`toLabel` support with label-to-ID resolution via `getGraphNodes()` (exact case-insensitive match). Clear error messages for missing nodes.
- Initial fix used `searchGraphNodes()` (semantic search) which failed for short proper nouns — switched to direct node list lookup

### Phase 4: Resource Finalization & Startup Safety (Session 27)

#### FIXED: MCP connect race condition — fire-and-forget startup
- **Severity**: High — `mcpClient.connect()` was not awaited; server init ran in parallel. First request after startup could fail if MCP handshake hadn't completed.
- **Location**: `src/main.ts:108`
- **Fix**: `await mcpClient.connect()` with try/catch. Offline fallback behavior preserved.

#### FIXED: Prepared statements not finalized on error paths
- **Severity**: Medium (resource leak) — `stmt.get()`/`stmt.run()` could throw before `stmt.finalize()`, leaking statement handles
- **Locations**: `src/entity/loop.ts:339`, `src/lorebook/state-manager.ts:92`
- **Fix**: Wrapped in try/finally blocks for guaranteed finalization

#### FIXED: Shell tool abort listener leak
- **Severity**: Medium (memory leak) — abort event listener registered without `{ once: true }`, never removed on normal completion
- **Location**: `src/tools/shell.ts:98`
- **Fix**: Added `{ once: true }` option to `addEventListener`

#### FIXED: MCP transport not cleaned up on connect failure
- **Severity**: Medium (resource leak) — if `client.connect()` threw, transport and client objects were left dangling
- **Location**: `src/mcp-client/mod.ts:164`
- **Fix**: Cleanup in catch block: `client.close()`, then null both references

## Confirmed Safe Patterns

- All SQLite queries are parameterized
- User/assistant messages rendered through `marked` + `DOMPurify`
- `isValidFilename()` properly checks for path traversal
- Background upload generates safe filenames server-side
- Background delete handler regex blocks traversal after URL decoding
- Prepared statements wrapped in try/finally for guaranteed finalization

## Post-Alpha Fixes

### OpenRouter image generation payload incorrect (High — functionality)
- **Problem**: Sent `size` (DALL-E parameter) which OpenRouter doesn't support on `/chat/completions`. Used wrong `modalities` ordering. Base URL trailing slash produced double-slash 404s.
- **Locations**: `src/tools/generate-image.ts:192-199`
- **Fix**: Replaced `size` with `image_config` (`aspect_ratio`, `image_size`); changed `modalities` to `["image", "text"]`; strip trailing slash from base URL.

### `[IMAGE:...]` marker regex fragile (Medium — rendering)
- **Problem**: Four locations used `[^}]+` which fails when prompt/description contains `}` characters. Also, server-side template regex required `<p>` wrapper that markdown render doesn't always produce.
- **Locations**: `src/entity/loop.ts:788`, `src/server/templates.ts:1455,1673`, `src/server/routes.ts:6672`
- **Fix**: Changed to `.*` (lazy) pattern, consistent with existing `fadeImageMarker` regex. Removed `<p>` wrapper requirement from template regex.

- Tool execution serialized across concurrent turns via promise mutex in `ToolRegistry.executeAll()`, preventing race conditions on shared resources (identity files, knowledge graph, memories) when multiple turns run simultaneously (e.g., background stream + new conversation, Pulse + user chat)

## Pulse System Bug Fixes

### Inactivity trigger rapid-fire (High — UX/exhaustion)
- **Problem**: `handleInactivityTick()` had no cooldown mechanism. Once the inactivity threshold was exceeded, the Pulse fired every minute (the cron tick interval). The `lastRunAt` guard present in `handleCronTick()` was missing from the inactivity handler.
- **Location**: `src/pulse/engine.ts` — `handleInactivityTick()`
- **Fix**: Added `lastRunAt` check — after firing, the Pulse won't fire again until the full threshold period has elapsed since the last run.

### Inactivity jitter window never fires for short thresholds (High — functionality)
- **Problem**: The jitter window was calculated as `threshold + [randomIntervalMin, randomIntervalMax]`. For a 4-min threshold, the window was 16.5–23.5 min instead of the intended 6.5–13.5 min. Combined with a max probability of 40% and only 1-2 tick chances, the Pulse frequently missed its window entirely. Additionally, once past the window, the Pulse was permanently suppressed (`elapsedMs > windowEndMs → return`).
- **Location**: `src/pulse/engine.ts` — `handleInactivityTick()` jitter logic
- **Fix**: Window now uses `randomIntervalMin/Max` as absolute elapsed times from the effective start. Upper window bound changed from hard return to fall-through, so the Pulse fires if the jitter window is missed.

### Inactivity trigger fires retroactively on enable (Medium — UX)
- **Problem**: The inactivity timer was based solely on `lastGlobalUserMessage`. Enabling a Pulse after the threshold had already elapsed caused it to fire immediately on the next tick.
- **Location**: `src/pulse/engine.ts` — `handleInactivityTick()` and `registerTriggers()`
- **Fix**: Track `inactivityEnabledAt` per Pulse (set to `Date.now()` on registration). Effective start time is `max(enabledAt, lastUserMessage)`. User activity still resets the clock as expected.

### Pulse run duration stored as literal SQL string (Medium — data integrity)
- **Problem**: `completePulseRun()` passed a CAST expression as a string parameter value instead of inlining it in the SQL. This stored `"CAST(...)"` as the duration_ms value and caused "column index out of range" errors (9 values for 8 placeholders).
- **Location**: `src/db/client.ts` — `completePulseRun()`
- **Fix**: Inlined the CAST expression in the SQL statement and adjusted parameter order to match the 8 placeholders.

### Pulse errors not reported to client (Medium — UX)
- **Problem**: When a visible Pulse failed (LLM error, etc.), the catch block only logged to console and updated the DB. No notification was sent to the client — the chat bar stayed active and no error toast appeared.
- **Location**: `src/pulse/engine.ts` — `executePulse()` catch block
- **Fix**: On error, broadcast `status` event with error details and `done` event with `"error"` to trigger the client's error UI (red toast + inline error message).

### Pulse streaming lost on SSE reconnection (Medium — UX)
- **Problem**: Pulse responses stream via the persistent SSE channel. If the EventSource connection drops during the inactivity wait (common on WSL2), all streaming events are lost. The user sees no response until manually refreshing.
- **Location**: `src/pulse/engine.ts` — `executePulse()`; `web/js/psycheros.js` — persistent SSE handlers
- **Fix**: Added `pulse_complete` event broadcast after Pulse execution (success or error). Client-side handler detects if streaming was missed (`pulseAssistantEl === null`) and reloads the conversation from the server.

### File inputs broken on cross-platform (High — functionality)
- **Problem**: All file inputs used `<button onclick="document.getElementById('input').click()">` to trigger a hidden file input, or `<label for>` with a separate hidden input. Both patterns fail on iOS Safari PWA, Android Chrome, Windows desktop browsers, and macOS Safari — the file picker never opens. Programmatic `.click()` and `<label for>` with `display:none`/`hidden` inputs don't reliably trigger native file pickers across browsers.
- **Locations**: `src/server/routes.ts` (vault), `src/server/templates.ts` (anchor, chat attachment, custom tool import, background upload)
- **Fix**: Placed `<input type="file">` inside a `<label>` wrapper with `position:relative;overflow:hidden` on the label and `position:absolute;inset:0;opacity:0` on the input. Clicking anywhere on the label directly clicks the file input element — no JavaScript, no `for` attribute. This is the only pattern that reliably works across all platforms including iOS PWA standalone mode. Applied to all five file inputs in the app.

### Settings link closes sidebar without navigating on Safari (High — functionality)
- **Problem**: Sidebar settings link was `<a>` without `href` with `onclick="Psycheros.closeSidebarAfterNav()"`. In Safari, `<a>` without `href` is not an interactive element — the inline `onclick` fires (closing the sidebar) but HTMX's `addEventListener`-based handler never fires, so no navigation occurs.
- **Location**: `src/server/templates.ts:1200`
- **Fix**: Changed `<a>` to `<button>` (always interactive in all browsers) with `onclick="Psycheros.closeSidebarAfterNav()"`. The `<button>` element ensures HTMX's addEventListener handler fires on Safari, so the `hx-get` request navigates to settings and the sidebar closes.

## Multi-Provider LLM Profiles

### Profile save race condition (High — data loss)
- **Problem**: Adding a new LLM profile used a client-side read-modify-write flow (GET all settings, push new profile, POST back). If the GET returned stale data (e.g., from cache, race condition, or HTMX page swap), existing profiles would be silently overwritten.
- **Location**: `src/server/templates.ts` — `saveProfile()` JS; `src/server/routes.ts` — `handleSaveLLMSettings()`
- **Fix**: Added `POST /api/llm-settings/profile` endpoint that handles add/update atomically on the server. The client now sends just the profile object; the server reads current settings, merges the profile in, and saves. The bulk `POST /api/llm-settings` is kept only for delete operations.

### Test connection credential mixing (Medium — security)
- **Problem**: `handleTestLLMConnection` fell back to the active profile's API key when the test profile's key was empty — even if the test profile had a different base URL. This could send requests to one provider with another provider's credentials.
- **Location**: `src/server/routes.ts` — `handleTestLLMConnection()`
- **Fix**: Credential fallback only triggers when ALL three values (baseUrl, apiKey, model) are empty on the test profile.

### Worker model thinking not disabled (Medium — unnecessary tokens)
- **Problem**: `createClientFromProfile()` with `useWorker: true` still had `thinkingEnabled` from the profile, causing lightweight tasks (auto-titling) to request chain-of-thought reasoning unnecessarily.
- **Location**: `src/llm/client.ts` — `createClientFromProfile()`
- **Fix**: `thinkingEnabled` defaults to `false` when `useWorker: true`, unless explicitly overridden.

## Memory System Bug Fixes

### Significant memories not indexed into RAG or synced to MCP (High — functionality)
- **Problem**: When the entity created a significant memory via the `create_significant_memory` tool, the file was written to disk but never indexed into RAG or synced to entity-core. The web UI path correctly called `reindexFile()` and `createMemory()` after writing, but the tool path only wrote the file. Significant memories were invisible to RAG search until the next server restart.
- **Location**: `src/tools/create-significant-memory.ts` — `execute()`; `src/entity/loop.ts` — `EntityConfig`
- **Fix**: Added `memoryIndexer` to `EntityConfig` (threaded from server through routes and pulse engine). The tool now calls `memoryIndexer.reindexFile()` and `mcpClient.createMemory()` after writing, both with non-fatal error handling. Existing significant memories on disk are unaffected — `indexAll()` on startup already indexes them.

## Chat Image Upload Bug Fixes

### Chat attachment file input had duplicate inputs with same ID (High — functionality)
- **Problem**: The Safari file input fix (`ed9892a`) wrapped the file input inside a `<label>` for cross-platform compatibility but left the old `display:none` file input with `onchange="Psycheros.handleAttachment(this)"` in place. The `<label>`-wrapped input had no `onchange` handler, and the orphaned input was never triggered by clicking the attach button. Selecting a file did nothing — no preview, no error, no upload.
- **Location**: `src/server/templates.ts` — `renderInputArea()`
- **Fix**: Removed the orphaned second file input and added the `onchange` handler to the `<label>`-wrapped input.

### [USER_IMAGE:...] markers not rendered as images in user messages (High — UX)
- **Problem**: When a conversation was loaded from the server, user messages containing `[USER_IMAGE: path | Caption: ... | Short: ...]` markers displayed the raw marker text instead of an inline image. The `renderUserMessage()` function passed content straight through `renderMarkdown()` without parsing user image markers (unlike `renderAssistantMessage()` which handled `[IMAGE:{...}]` markers). Additionally, the client-side `sendMessage()` function didn't render the attachment image in the user message bubble, and blocked sending image-only messages (no text).
- **Location**: `src/server/templates.ts` — `renderUserMessage()`; `web/js/psycheros.js` — `sendMessage()`
- **Fix**: Added `[USER_IMAGE:...]` marker parsing in `renderUserMessage()` to render inline images. Added client-side attachment rendering in `sendMessage()`. Changed guard to allow image-only sends with a fallback placeholder text.

### User image description fading never triggered (Medium — token waste)
- **Problem**: `buildFadeMap()` in the agentic loop only tracked `[IMAGE:{...}]` markers (generated images) for fading, missing `[USER_IMAGE:...]` markers entirely. User-uploaded images kept both longform Caption and shortform Short in context indefinitely, wasting tokens on verbose descriptions that the entity no longer needs.
- **Location**: `src/entity/loop.ts` — `buildFadeMap()`
- **Fix**: Added `\[USER_IMAGE:` check alongside the existing `\[IMAGE:\{` check in the first pass.

### renderUserMessage regex `[^]]` parsed incorrectly by JavaScript (High — rendering)
- **Problem**: The regex to match `[USER_IMAGE:...]` markers used `[^]]*` intending "any character except `]`". However, JavaScript parses `[^]]` as `[^]` (match any character including newline) followed by a literal `]` — not as a negated character class. This caused the regex to never match messages with long captions, displaying raw `[USER_IMAGE: ... | Caption: long text | Short: short]` instead of the image.
- **Location**: `src/server/templates.ts` — `renderUserMessage()`
- **Fix**: Changed `[^]]*` to `[^\]]*` (properly escaped `]` inside the character class).

### Image captioning ByteString error on Windows (High — functionality)
- **Problem**: The `describe_image` tool and auto-captioning path failed with `"headers of RequestInit is not valid ByteString"` when using OpenRouter on Windows. Main chat worked fine — failure was isolated to the captioning request construction. Copying/pasting API keys or base URLs on Windows can inject invisible non-ASCII characters (zero-width spaces, BOM, smart quotes). `.trim()` alone does not catch these. The Fetch API rejects header values containing characters outside the Latin-1 range (code points > 255) as invalid ByteString.
- **Location**: `src/tools/describe-image.ts` — `captionViaOpenRouter()`, `captionViaOpenRouterDual()`, `captionViaGemini()`, `captionViaGeminiDual()`; `src/tools/generate-image.ts` — `generateViaOpenRouter()`, `generateViaGemini()`
- **Fix**: Added `sanitizeHeaderValue()` to `src/tools/generate-image.ts` (exported, reused by `describe-image.ts`). Strips all characters outside the printable ASCII + extended Latin range (`[^\x20-\x7E\x80-\xFF]`) from header values before constructing HTTP requests. Applied across all 6 request construction sites (4 in describe-image.ts, 2 in generate-image.ts). Also fixed inconsistent captioning config access — `generate-image.ts` used `ctx.config.captioningSettings` (a separate field) while `describe-image.ts` and `look-closer.ts` used `ctx.config.imageGenSettings?.captioning`. Standardized to the latter and removed the redundant `captioningSettings` field from `EntityConfig`.

### Lorebook sticky entries expired by Pulse turns (High — functionality)
- **Problem**: Sticky lorebook entry turn counters were decremented on every evaluation, including Pulse/automated turns. When a Pulse fired in the same conversation (or in its own conversation assigned to the user's thread), it consumed sticky duration that was earned by real user conversation. A Pulse firing 4+ times could exhaust a `stickyDuration: 5` entry before the user returned to the thread. Additionally, when all sticky entries expired, stale `lorebook_state` rows were not cleaned up from the database — they persisted until the next evaluate call for that conversation.
- **Location**: `src/lorebook/evaluator.ts` — Step 3 (sticky processing); `src/lorebook/manager.ts` — `evaluate()`; `src/pulse/engine.ts` — `executePulse()`; `src/entity/loop.ts` — `ProcessOptions`
- **Fix**: Added `skipStickyDecrement` flag to `EvaluationOptions`, `LorebookManager.evaluate()`, and `ProcessOptions`. When set (automatically for Pulse turns), sticky entries are preserved with their current `turnsRemaining` unchanged and still appear in context, but the counter is not decremented. Pulse turns can still trigger entries and re-trigger resets the timer normally. Also added `clearState()` call in `evaluate()` when all entries expire, to clean up stale database rows.

### Entity-created Pulses never fire (Critical — functionality)
- **Problem**: Three interacting bugs prevented entity-created Pulses from working at all:
  1. `setPulseEngine()` was exported from `pulse-tools.ts` but never imported or called anywhere. The `pulseEngine` variable was always `null`, so `registerTriggers()` and `executePulse()` were silently no-ops.
  2. Even if wired up, `executeCreate()` saved the Pulse to the database but never called `pulseEngine.registerTriggers()`. The engine only loaded Pulses at startup, so Pulses created mid-session were invisible to the scheduler.
  3. No `run_at` parameter existed — entities could only use `interval_seconds` for "in N minutes" prompts, but the engine interpreted this as a recurring schedule (`*/30 * * * *`), producing wrong fire times.
- **Location**: `src/tools/pulse-tools.ts` — `executeCreate()`; `src/server/server.ts` — startup
- **Fix**: Added `setPulseEngine(this.pulseEngine)` call in server startup. Added `registerTriggers()` call after `createPulse()` in the tool. Added `run_at` parameter for one-shot scheduling. Added timezone conversion (display TZ → UTC) for `run_at`, `cron_expression` (daily/weekly/monthly patterns).

### One-shot Pulses disable before executing (Critical — functionality)
- **Problem**: `handleCronTick()` called `updatePulse({ enabled: false, runAt: null })` before `executePulse()`. Since `executePulse()` re-reads the Pulse from the DB and checks `pulse.enabled`, it immediately returned without executing. The one-shot Pulse was disabled but never ran.
- **Location**: `src/pulse/engine.ts` — `handleCronTick()`
- **Fix**: Only clear `runAt` before execution (to prevent re-fire). Disable the Pulse after `executePulse()` completes (unless auto-deleted).

### Pulse sidebar indicator missing on entity tool calls (Medium — UX)
- **Problem**: When an entity created or deleted a Pulse via the tool, the sidebar conversation list never refreshed to show/hide the Pulse icon indicator. The tool returned a plain string result without specifying `affectedRegions`.
- **Location**: `src/tools/pulse-tools.ts` — `executeCreate()`, `executeDelete()`
- **Fix**: Added `affectedRegions: ["conv-list"]` to create and delete tool results, triggering a sidebar refresh.

### Pulse messages rendered as user messages after reload (Medium — rendering)
- **Problem**: `renderMessage()` checked only `msg.pulseId` to decide whether to use Pulse styling. Entity-created Pulse messages had `pulse_name` set but `pulse_id` was null (legacy artifact), so they rendered as regular user messages after page reload.
- **Location**: `src/server/templates.ts` — `renderMessage()`
- **Fix**: Changed condition to `if (msg.pulseId || msg.pulseName)`.

### Captioning API key overwritten by masked value on save (High — functionality)
- **Problem**: The Vision settings page renders captioning API keys in masked form (`sk-••••••••b0a3`) via `maskImageGenSettings()`. When the user saved captioning settings, the browser sent the masked value back to the server. The `handleSaveImageGenSettings()` captioning-only path (`!body.generators && body.captioning`) blindly wrote the masked key back to disk, overwriting the real API key. Subsequent captioning requests sent the masked key as the `Authorization` header — after `sanitizeHeaderValue()` stripped the Unicode `•` characters, the result was a truncated invalid key, causing 401 errors. The generator save path (`handleSaveImageGenSlot`) already had mask-detection logic, but the captioning path did not.
- **Location**: `src/server/routes.ts` — `handleSaveImageGenSettings()`
- **Fix**: Added masked key detection before writing — if the incoming `apiKey` contains `••••`, the existing real key from current settings is preserved instead. Matches the pattern already used by the generator save handler.
